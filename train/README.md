# Customizable Dominos - Mexican Train Token

Simple, easy to print, train token for playing Mexican Train dominos.

## Generated File Settings

There are generated STL and 3MF files in the dist folder.

## Printing

### Filament

You can use any filament to print the token. My recommendation is to consider how often you want to use it and how delicate your players are and choose something accordingly.  For example, if you have a Silk PLA you think would be beautiful but it breaks or scuffs easily, then that may not be the best choice if you plan to use it often.

### Print Settings

The standard print settings that you prefer for your choosen filament will usually work fine.

If you see any irregularities around the perimeter, consider lowering your outer wall acceleration and/or jerk settings.
